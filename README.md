## Getting Started

**1. Install package**

```bash
npm i @dashibase/lotion
```

**2. Basic Lotion editor**

The following Vue component will initialize a basic Lotion editor.

```javascript
<template>
  <Lotion :page="page" />
</template>
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref } from 'vue'
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid'
import { Lotion, registerBlock } from '@dashibase/lotion'

const page = ref({
  name: 'ðŸ§´ Lotion',
  blocks:[{
    id: uuidv4(),
    type: 'TEXT',
    details: {
      value: 'Hello, World!'
    },
  }],
})
</script>
```

**3. Create custom components**

See `examples/CustomBlock.vue` for an example of a custom block.

The custom block component can accept the following props:
- `block`: A `Block` object. See `src/utils/types.ts` for details.
- `readonly`: A boolean, which sets whether the block/editor is in read-only mode.

The custom block component can also optionally expose the following methods (remember to call `defineExpose`):
- `onSet`: This is triggered when a user converts any block into this blocktype. It is called before the blocktype is changed.
- `onUnset`: This is triggered when a user converts this block into any blocktype. It is called before the blocktype is changed.

```javascript
<template>
  <div>
    ðŸ§´
  </div>
</template>
<script setup lang="ts">
import { PropType } from 'vue'
import { types } from '../src'

const props = defineProps({
  block: {
    type: Object as PropType<types.Block>,
    required: true,
  },
  readonly: {
    type: Boolean,
    default: false,
  },
})

function onSet () {
  alert('Moisturizing...')
}

function onUnset () {
  alert('Moisturized!')
}

defineExpose({
  onSet,
  onUnset,
})
</script>

```

**4. Register custom components**

See `examples/Example.vue` for an example of registering a custom block.

After creating the custom component, register it as follows:

```javascript
import CustomBlock from './CustomBlock.vue'
import { addIcons } from "oh-vue-icons"
import { FaPumpSoap } from "oh-vue-icons/icons"
import { registerBlock } from '@dashibase/lotion'

// Add the icon (from oh-vue-icons.js.org/)
addIcons(FaPumpSoap)
// Register the block
// registerBlock('<BLOCK_TYPE_ID>', '<BLOCK_TYPE_LABEL>', <BLOCK_COMPONENT>, 'BLOCK_ICON')
registerBlock('LOTION', 'Moisturize', CustomBlock, 'fa-pump-soap')
</script>
```

After that, you should be able to see the custom block when the user opens the menu to switch to different blocks.

## Contributing

**1. Clone this repository, go to the root directory and install packages**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dashibase/lotion
cd lotion
npm i
```

**2. Run dev**

```bash
npm run dev
```

If you head to http://localhost:5173 on your browser, you should see what looks like the screenshot above.

**3. Contribute!**

Lotion is quite limited for now but we hope it serves as a good starting point for other folks looking to build their own editors.

We would love to make Lotion more extensible and welcome any suggestions or contributions!

See CONTRIBUTING.md for details.
